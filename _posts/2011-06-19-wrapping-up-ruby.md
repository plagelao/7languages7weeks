Ruby is fun.

Even though its performance is not as good as other languages, Matz has created a language that optmizes the efficency of the programmers. It makes possible to implement an idea in a very short time.

Metaprogramming in Ruby is so powerful that you can modify the whole language. It is very funny to play with it anf I'm definitly going to study metaprogramming deeper.

As the author says, Ruby weaknesses are performance and concurrency. Performance is not a problem for me right now. I've never had to optimize an application that much, I think I'm not going to have that need in the near future. Concurrency is more likely to be a real problem some day, but we'll walk that road once we get there. Right now, Ruby strengths are much more important to me than its weaknesses.

And that's all for ruby, see you tomorrow! We'll talk about Io. Really looking forward to it.
