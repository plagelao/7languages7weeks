I really enjoyed learning Io, I think I've understood better prototype languages (Javascript, I'm thinking about you). However, [Aimee](http://www.twitter/sermoa) asked  in asked today's group meeting if any of us were going to use Io for a new project. The reality is that I won't. I can't see where it may fit.

Anyway, I want to close this week showing you a mini testing framework based on Aimee's ideas and RSpec. Is just a toy, but I wanted to apply some of the learning to a "real" project. [You can see it here](https://github.com/plagelao/plagel.io)

And that's all for Io, see you tomorrow! We'll talk about prolog. Really looking forward to it.
