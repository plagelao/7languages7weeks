And here we are, last day with prolog. Today, we learn how to solve puzzles! The author showed us how to solve Sudokus and the Eight Queens puzzle. It is mind blowing, and shows how awesome prolog is. Seriously.
The only problem I have with this day is that the exercises are just simple variations of the puzzles already solved by the author, so doing them is not a real challenge. Anyway, I want to show you how to solve a Sudoku with prolog, so let's do one of the exercises together.

- Modify the Sudoku solver to work on 9x9 puzzle.
